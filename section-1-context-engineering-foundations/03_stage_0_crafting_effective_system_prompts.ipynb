    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Stage 0 of the course. Before we build complex retrieval systems, we need to define who our agent is. In this preliminary stage, we'll focus on the foundation of all context: **System Instructions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we'll do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Define Identity**: Learn how to set the agent's role, capabilities, and constraints.\n",
    "2.  **Experiment with Prompts**: See firsthand how different system instructions change the agent's behavior.\n",
    "3.  **Apply to the Agent**: Use a special hook to inject your custom system prompt into our Stage 1 Baseline Agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in."

    "2.  **What it can do** - Capabilities and tools\n",
