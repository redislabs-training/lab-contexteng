    "# Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've gotten a introduction to the basics of what context engineering is and the basics of how it works, we'll dive into the project you'll be building in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course, you'll progressively build a course advisor agent - an AI assistant that helps students discover and explore courses from a catalog. Starting with a simple retrieval system, you'll incrementally build up to a full agent while exploring how to construct context and apply common context engineering techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each implementation in this course tackles a different challenge: making your agent token-efficient so it doesn't waste context, handling multi-turn conversations where users ask follow-up questions, combining semantic search with exact matching for precision, remembering user preferences across sessions, and improving the agent's reasoning process transparent for debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll have built 7 progressively advanced implementations, each solving specific context engineering challenges you'll encounter in real-world AI systems."

    "## Course Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a total of 8 stages in this course to reach the final agent implementation: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 0: Crafting Effective System Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we build onto the agent's capabilities, we'll want to work with system context. It's the easiest context to manage because it is likely if you have written prompts before, it will be the most familiar! In this preliminary stage, you'll learn how to craft effective system instructions that define your agent's role, capabilities, and behavioral constraints. You'll see how a well-crafted system prompt acts as the foundation for all other context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 1: Baseline RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you're building a chatbot, documentation assistant, or complex agentic system, you'll likely need to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base, assemble context for the language model, and generate responses grounded in that context. Most applications implement this in a form of a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will start with observing a basic RAG application because context engineering fundamentals apply to *all* AI systems - from simple one-shot applications to complex multi-agent workflows. You'll learn to engineer context effectively in basic systems before tackling the additional complexity of agents, memory, and reasoning loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent presented in stage 1 will show off how basic retrieval works but is inefficient. You'll observe what happens when you DON'T engineer context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 2: Context-Engineered RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you observe the limits of a basic non-context-engineered RAG system, we'll then apply some basic context engineering techniques. You'll see why context engineering isn't about retrieving more - it's about assembling LESS context more intelligently.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll implement context cleaning, transformation, and optimization to reduce token usage by over 50% while maintaining quality. Additionally, you'll explore system context by engineering a more effective system prompt. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 3: From RAG to Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "This stage is when we really kick it into gear. In stages 1 and 2, what we called an agent was essentially just a RAG pipeline. This stage will transform the RAG system into a LangGraph-based agent with defined tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll implement intent classification, query decomposition, quality evaluation, and a hierarchical retrieval strategy. Don't worry if these terms don't sound familiar just yet, they are all just ways we will improve the context our application uses!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 4: Hybrid Search with NER\n",
    "\n",
    "In this stage, we tackle a \"precision\" problem. Semantic search is great for concepts but often fails on specific identifiers like \"CS101\". We'll upgrade our retrieval context by adding named entity recognition (NER) to extract course codes and combine exact matching (FilterQuery) with semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll learn how to build a hybrid retrieval system that merges results based on intent, giving the agent precise \"anchors\" in its context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 4R: ReAct Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In this stage we'll take another leap by upgrading our agent with a ReAct (reasoning + acting) agent architecture pattern. The agent's own \"thoughts\" become part of the context window, allowing it to reason about the data it retrieves.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see how explicit reasoning traces help the agent self-correct and provide a powerful debugging tool for you as the engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 5: Agent with Working Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we add the dimension of time and explore managing conversational context. We'll integrate the Redis [Agent Memory Server](https://github.com/redis/agent-memory-server) to implement working memory and inject conversation history into the context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see the agent explicitly \"read\" the conversation history to resolve pronouns (like \"Tell me more about *it*\") and maintain context across multiple turns. This is where the agent truly starts to feel \"intelligent.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 6: Agent with Long Term Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "In our final stage, we'll add the final piece by introducing long-term memory, allowing the agent to store and recall user preferences across different sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you'll have a fully functional ReAct agent with properly managed context across tools, memory, and retrieved knowledge.\n"
