### Jupyter Notebook Interface FAQ

<details>
<summary> How do I run each block of code? </summary>

There are three ways to run a code cell after you select it:

- Press `Shift + Enter`
- Click the "Run" button (play icon) in the toolbar of the notebook.
- Click the "Run" button (play icon) in the cell itself at the top right corner.

When you run a code cell, it will execute the code inside it and display the output directly below the cell. If there are any errors, they will also be displayed in the output area.

<summary> How do I reset each notebook environment? </summary>

Sometimes you may want to reset the notebook to its initial state. To do this, you can use the "Restart Kernel and Clear All Outputs" option from the "Kernel" menu at the top of the Jupyter interface. This will clear all outputs and reset the kernel, allowing you to start fresh. This reset only affects the current notebook and does not impact any other notebooks or the Redis instance running in the background.

<summary> How do I know if the notebook is running? </summary>

If you are ever wondering if a code block is still running, you can check the top right corner of the Jupyter interface. If the kernel is busy, it will show a circle icon that is filled in. If the kernel is idle, it will show an empty circle icon.

Idle kernel:
