    "\n",
    "While managing the size of your context window is critical, simply fitting everything in isn't the only hurdle. As D. Breunig highlights in [How Contexts Fail (and How to Fix Them)](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html), there are several other ways that context can degrade the performance of your agent, even when you are well within the token limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "He mentions four key failure modes to watch out for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Context Poisoning**: This occurs when an error or hallucination makes its way into your context (e.g., conversation history) and is then treated as fact in subsequent turns. The model \"learns\" the wrong information from its own previous output, leading to a loop of compounding errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Context Distraction**: As highlighted also by Chroma, sometimes, having *too much* history can be detrimental. If an agent has a massive log of past actions, it may start to over-focus on repeating those past behaviors rather than reasoning about the current, novel situation. It relies on its \"contextual habit\" instead of its training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Context Confusion**: This happens when the context is cluttered with superfluous information—such as too many available tools or irrelevant document snippets. Even if the model *could* ignore them, the mere presence of these \"distractors\" increases the probability of the model getting confused or trying to use a tool that isn't needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Context Clash**: This is when different parts of your context contradict each other. For example, your system prompt might say one thing, but a retrieved document or an early turn in the conversation history says the opposite. When the model faces this internal conflict, its reasoning capabilities often degrade significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these failure modes reinforces why context engineering is not just about *compression*—it's about *curation*. We must actively manage, clean, and sometimes even \"forget\" context to keep our agents sharp.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we will not solve every one of these failure modes. Some, like context poisoning, remain as complex open research problems in AI. However, we will systematically dismantle the most common ones by building a series of \"progressive agents,\" each designed to overcome specific context limitations."

    "## Best Practices for Context Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on what we've learned, here are five essential practices to follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start simple, add complexity gradually** \n",
    "   - Begin with system context only\n",
    "   - Add user context when you have it\n",
    "   - Retrieve additional context only when needed\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Measure token usage continuously**\n",
    "   - Track how much of your context window is being used\n",
    "   - Set alerts before hitting limits\n",
    "   - Monitor growth patterns over conversation length\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Optimize for relevance, not completeness**\n",
    "   - Don't dump all available information into context\n",
    "   - Retrieve only what's relevant to the current query\n",
    "   - Filter and rank retrieved content by relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use clear, structured formatting**\n",
    "   - Organize context with headers and sections\n",
    "   - Use bullet points and key-value pairs\n",
    "   - Make it easy for the model to find information\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Test different context combinations**\n",
    "   - Experiment with what to include vs. exclude\n",
    "   - Measure response quality with different strategies\n",
    "   - Iterate based on real user interactions"

    "## Wrap Up\n",
    "\n",
    "In this introduction, we started to explore how real AI applications depend on carefully constructed context. More specifically we covered the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Context engineering is the practice of deliberately shaping the information surrounding an application, rather than just crafting individual prompts.\n",
    "2. There are four types of context we will focus on: system context, user context, conversation context, and retrieved context.\n",
    "3. All LLMs have fixed context windows, creating a fundamental constraint where every token used for one purpose is unavailable for another.\n",
    "4. Context rot is a phenomenon where LLM performance degrades as input context length increases, even on simple tasks.\n",
    "5. Context failures such as distraction, confusion, and clash occur when irrelevant or contradictory information is present in the context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready to start building. In **Module 2: Data Engineering for Context**, we will learn how to prepare data for LLM consumption—the critical step before implementing RAG. We'll cover the data pipeline, chunking decisions, and see how context engineering can achieve 91% token reduction."
