    "- **Search**: Semantic (vector) search only\n",

    "### Stage 2: Context-Engineered (Optimized)\n",
    "- **Improvement**: Applies context engineering techniques\n",
    "- **Result**: ~539 tokens (91% reduction)\n",

    "- **Search**: Semantic (vector) search only\n",

    "### Stage 3: Hierarchical Retrieval (Production-Ready)\n",
    "- **Improvement**: Progressive disclosure + intent classification\n",
