"""
Course Q&A Agent - Stage 4 ReAct (Hybrid Search with NER + ReAct Loop)

A LangGraph-based agent for answering questions about courses using:
- Hybrid search (semantic + exact match)
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) for course codes
- ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) loop for explicit reasoning

This is an alternative to Stage 4 that adds ReAct capabilities.
