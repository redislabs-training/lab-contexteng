    "# Stage 3: Hierarchical Retrieval & Intent-Driven Context\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that at the beginning of this course, we defined context engineering as the practice of deliberately shaping what information reaches the LLM, and in what form. It's not just about *what* we retrieve — it's also about *how we structure it*, *when we include it*, and *how much detail we provide*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our stage 1 naive RAG, we saw that if we include *everything* in the context (the entire course catalog), we overwhelm the LLM, waste tokens, and, based on research from top AI companies, would eventually create issues like context rot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In stage 2, we tackled how to structure the context. We explored how to start to shape data to be both LLM-friendly and task-appropriate. We built two representations of the same data:\n",
    "- `transform_course_to_text` gave us a full, human-readable format (structured for comprehension)\n",
    "- `optimize_course_text` gave us a compressed, essentials-only version (optimized for token efficiency)\n",
    "\n",
    "This was our way of presenting the same piece of information at different granularities, and *how* we format it matters as much as what we include.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this implementation was simple because it had a critical limitation: the context was static. We chose one representation strategy (full or optimized) at the start, and every query — whether *\"What machine learning courses exist?\"* or *\"What is the week 1 assignment for CS101?\"* — received the same treatment. The pipeline didn't adapt to the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this stage, we'll add intelligence: instead of choosing one strategy for all queries, we'll build a system that analyzes the user's intent and dynamically adjusts the context's structure and depth in response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what we'll build:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hierarchical Data Models (Structure)**  \n",
    "   Instead of choosing between \"full\" or \"optimized,\" we'll formalize two distinct *views* of the data:\n",
    "   - Summary View: Lightweight, ~50-100 tokens per item. Perfect for browsing.\n",
    "   - Details View: Comprehensive, ~500-1000 tokens per item. Contains the full syllabus, assignments, and learning objectives.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This is a layered context design, providing the system with multiple lenses through which to view the same underlying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Context Assembly with Progressive Disclosure (Presentation)**  \n",
    "   We'll use research-backed techniques to structure context for maximum LLM comprehension:\n",
    "   - Place summaries at the beginning (high-level map)\n",
    "   - Place details at the end (specifics are \"fresh\" when generating)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This combats the [\"Lost in the Middle\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03172) phenomenon and is positional context optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Intent Classification (Decision)**  \n",
    "   Not all questions require the same information depth. We'll teach the system to classify user queries by information need:\n",
    "   - *\"What courses are there?\"* → Need: breadth (summaries only)\n",
    "   - *\"What will I learn in CS101?\"* → Need: depth (full details)\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This will serve as a query-aware context selection strategy where the context we provide adapts to the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Quality Evaluation (Validation)**  \n",
    "   Before sending context to the LLM, we'll validate: *\"Is this information actually sufficient to answer the question?\"*  \n",
    "   If not, we automatically retrieve again with a different strategy.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This is feedback-driven context refinement—the system learns from its mistakes in real-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of Stage 3, we'll have built a system that practices adaptive, validated context engineering:\n",
    "- It analyzes the question to determine the information depth needed\n",
    "- It assembles context hierarchically (breadth-first, then depth)\n",
    "- It validates quality before use\n",
    "- It automatically corrects insufficient context\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started."

    "## Part 1: The Data Structure (Hierarchical Models)\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, we're going to formalize two distinct views of our data:\n",
    "1.  `CourseSummary`: A lightweight model (~50-100 tokens) for browsing and broad search.\n",
    "2.  `CourseDetails`: A comprehensive model (~500-1000 tokens) containing the full syllabus, assignments, and prerequisites.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll keep the summary view fairly straightforward. It will simply be a flat list of fields, such as title, code, and instructor. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the details view is a bit more complex. To represent a full course faithfully, we can't just use a giant string of text. We need structured data to allow for precise rendering and querying. A real university course has a syllabus composed of weekly plans, assignments with specific metadata (including due dates and points), and prerequisites.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we flattened all this into a single string, we'd lose the ability to format it dynamically or query specific parts (e.g., \"What is due in Week 3?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep the agent organized, the data models are split into two files (which you can feel free to explore):\n",
    "*   `src/redis_context_course/models.py`: Contains the core domain entities and enums (like `DifficultyLevel`, `CourseFormat`) that are used everywhere.\n",
    "*   `src/redis_context_course/hierarchical_models.py`: Contains the specialized structures (like `WeekPlan`, `Assignment`) that are specifically designed for this hierarchical retrieval strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is what the `WeekPlan` specialized structure looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class WeekPlan(BaseModel):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Detailed plan for a single week of the course.\"\"\"\n",
    "    week_number: int\n",
    "    topic: str\n",
    "    subtopics: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)\n",
    "    readings: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)\n",
    "    assignments: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)\n",
    "    learning_objectives: List[str] = Field(default_factory=list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to `WeekPlan`, there are also models for the following:\n",
    "*   `CourseSyllabus`: A collection of `WeekPlan` objects.\n",
    "*   `Assignment`: Structured details like `due_week`, `points`, and `type` (Exam vs Project).\n",
    "*   `Prerequisite`: Links to other course codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models act as the \"schema\" for the detailed view. The `CourseDetails` model will utilize them as fields (e.g., `syllabus: CourseSyllabus`), effectively serving as a container for this rich information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Two-Tier Storage Architecture\n",

    "Having established our two-tier data structure, we now face a new challenge: how do we arrange this information to maximize the LLM's ability to understand and use it effectively? This is where progressive disclosure comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Progressive disclosure means showing only the information needed, when it's needed, in the optimal order. In traditional interfaces, this means starting with high-level categories, then allowing users to drill down into specifics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This matters because of how LLMs process context. Research shows they pay more attention to information at the beginning and end of their context window (the \"Lost in the Middle\" problem), while processing hierarchically structured information more effectively than flat lists. By placing summaries at the start, we create navigational landmarks. By placing details at the end, we leverage recency bias during generation. This is context engineering in action: deliberately shaping not just what information is included, but where it's positioned and how densely it's packed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our course search system, we structure context in two layers. The overview layer places all `CourseSummary` objects at the start to create a high-level map, answering the question \"What options exist?\" The deep dive layer places full `CourseDetails` for the most relevant courses at the very end—providing comprehensive information where the LLM's attention is naturally high.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Task 1: Implement the Context Assembler\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you'll find a `ContextAssembler` class. Your task is to implement the two methods that decide *how* to arrange course information for the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parent class `HierarchicalContextAssembler` (located in `src/redis_context_course/hierarchical_context.py`) provides two helper methods you can call:\n",
    "- `self._format_summary(summary, index)` - Formats a single course summary with numbering\n",
    "- `self._format_details(details)` - Formats full course details including syllabus and assignments\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need to complete the two main assembly strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`assemble_summary_only_context(summaries, query)`**: For general queries like \"What CS courses exist?\"\n",
    "   - Return a string with: header, count, and all summaries formatted with `self._format_summary()`\n",
    "   - This is the \"breadth-first\" strategy (overview only)\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary>🛠️ Show Implementation Details</summary>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "Build a string by populating the `sections` list with the following:\n",
    " \n",
    "1. Add aheader using `sections.append()`: `f\"# Course Search Results for: {query}\\n\"`\n",
    "2. Add a count: `f\"Found {len(summaries)} relevant courses:\\n\"`\n",
    "3. Loop through summaries using `enumerate(summaries, 1)` to get index `i` starting from 1\n",
    "4. For each summary, call `self._format_summary(summary, i)` and append to sections\n",
    "5. Join all sections with `\"\\n\".join(sections)` and return the result\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`assemble_hierarchical_context(summaries, details, query)`**: For detailed queries like \"What will I learn in CS101?\"\n",
    "   - Return a string with: header, \"Overview\" section with all summaries, \"Detailed Information\" section with full details\n",
    "   - This is the \"progressive disclosure\" strategy (breadth first, then depth)\n",
    "\n",
    "<details><summary>🛠️ Show Implementation Details</summary>\n",
    "<br>    \n",
    "    \n",

    "   - Loop through summaries with `enumerate(summaries, 1)` and append `self._format_summary(summary, i)`\n",

    "   - Intro: `\"Full syllabi and assignments for the most relevant courses:\\n\"`\n",
    "   - Loop through details and append `self._format_details(detail)` for each\n",

    "## Part 3: Intent Classification (Query-Aware Context Selection)\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have hierarchical data models (Part 1) and progressive disclosure assembly (Part 2). We're just missing the piece that allows the agent to adapt to the question being asked. This is where intent classification comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the context engineering problem we're solving:\n",
    "\n",
    "If someone asks *\"What is CS101?\"* → They need a summary (cheap, fast, ~100 tokens)  \n",
    "If someone asks *\"Show me the syllabus for CS101\"* → They need full details (expensive, thorough, ~1000 tokens)\n",
    "\n",
    "Without intent classification, we'd face a context engineering dilemma:\n",
    "1. Always return full details → wasteful, slow, expensive, and risks overwhelming the LLM with unnecessary information\n",
    "2. Always return summaries → incomplete, frustrating, and fails to provide sufficient context for detailed queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Intent Classification is the decision layer in our agent's flow. It analyzes the query to determine what level of detail the LLM needs to generate a quality response.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a system that routes queries based on five retrieval strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- GREETING → Skip search entirely, return friendly response\n",
    "- GENERAL → Return course summaries only (~500 tokens for 5 courses)\n",
    "- PREREQUISITES → Return course summaries only (prerequisite codes are included in summaries)\n",
    "- SYLLABUS_OBJECTIVES → Return summaries + full details (~2000 tokens)\n",
    "- ASSIGNMENTS → Return summaries + full details (~2000 tokens)\n",
    "\n",
    "The classifier acts as an early filter. It determines whether to run the full agent workflow or short-circuit with a simple greeting response. This saves unnecessary API calls and retrieval operations for queries that don't need them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Task 2: Implement the Intent Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to build a query classification function that analyzes user questions and determines the appropriate retrieval strategy. This classifier serves as the decision layer in your agent's workflow, routing queries to either skip search entirely (for greetings) or determining the depth of information needed (summaries vs. full details).\n",
    "\n",
    "The function will use an LLM to evaluate the query against five intent categories (GREETING, GENERAL, SYLLABUS_OBJECTIVES, ASSIGNMENTS, PREREQUISITES) and return the most appropriate category. We've provided the classification prompt with clear category definitions and examples.\n",

    "In the agent code, the complex logic for connecting to Redis and assembling the context is already defined by a function called `search_courses_sync` (located in `agent/tools.py`).

    "## Part 5: Quality Evaluation (Context Validation)\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have all the pieces to retrieve context intelligently (hierarchical data, intent classification, tool calling). But we're missing something critical: validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to LangChain's [2025 State of Agent Engineering survey](https://www.langchain.com/state-of-agent-engineering#biggest-barriers-to-production), output quality and reliability remain the #1 barrier to putting agents into production. Teams can build sophisticated retrieval pipelines, but if they can't consistently validate the quality of what they're retrieving, they can't trust their systems in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if the search returns irrelevant results? What if the retrieved context doesn't actually answer the question? In a production system, we can't afford to send poor-quality context to the LLM and hope for the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where quality evaluation comes in. It's a validation gate that checks: *\"Is the retrieved context good enough?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "To track quality in our agent,  we'll use a technique called LLM-as-a-Judge, one of the most widely adopted evaluation techniques (according to the same LangChain survey). \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're unfamiliar with the LLM-as-a-Judge technique, it's essentially using a separate LLM call specifically designed to evaluate quality against explicit criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "After our system retrieves context, we ask an LLM (serving the role of an evaluator) to score it on four dimensions:\n",
    "- **Completeness**: Does this context fully answer the question?\n",
    "- **Accuracy**: Is the information correct and relevant?\n",
    "- **Relevance**: Does it directly address what was asked?\n",
    "- **Grounding**: Does it reference specific courses (not generic knowledge)?\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluator returns a quality score (0.0 to 1.0):\n",
    "- **Score ≥ 0.7**: \"Good enough\" → Proceed to synthesis\n",
    "- **Score < 0.7**: \"Insufficient\" → Trigger another search\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a feedback loop where poor results automatically trigger re-retrieval.\n",
