    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few years, AI applications have undergone rapid evolution. Early on, engineers built a polite clerk behind a glass window: users would slide a note - \"draft this email,\" \"explain this code\" — and the clerk would read it, scribble an answer, and slide it back. Their answers were generally good, but not always what we wanted. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both engineers and users of these AI systems quickly realized that if they *precisely* engineer what the note says, they can, in turn, achieve better results from the clerk. So, they used more precise instructions — \"act as my editor,\" \"use this tone,\" \"return a table\" — and the outputs became sharper. This, in turn, became the practice of prompt engineering. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt engineering took these applications further, but eventually showed its limits — especially with our clerk behind the glass. Many times, we would hope the wording we provided would stick, but the longer notes got slow and contradictory. Sometimes, when we modified small parts of the prompt, the system's behavior changed in ways that were difficult to predict or control, and no amount of wordsmithing seemed to fully rectify the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a while, if you were an engineer building with these systems, the playbook for solving these issues was simple: upgrade the model. Swap in the latest version, and your clerk would provide sharper responses, have a better grasp of nuance, and possess the capability to undertake specialized tasks like research or creative exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, upgrading the model did indeed help! The clerk began to catch more nuances in the notes that were passed. It could juggle longer instructions, synthesize more information, and make fewer obvious mistakes. For many engineers, it felt like the main knob to turn was simply: use a bigger, smarter model.\n",
    "\n",
    "But under the hood, no matter how powerful a model became, the old cracks were still there. The AI system's clerk was still working mostly from whatever happened to be on the note in front of them. They still forgot everything between one visit and the next. When they didn’t know something, they would still guess instead of checking. In other words, we’d upgraded the clerk, but not the glass, not the office, and not the way work flowed around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then...came agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of a clerk answering one note at a time, we started asking that same clerk to run tasks, such as breaking down a goal, fetching information from the internet, and reading and updating complex code. Our polite assistant became a sort of project manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our metaphor, it was as if we took the clerk from behind the glass and said: \"Feel free to walk the halls. Use the phone, dig through the filing cabinets, talk to other departments, and come back with a finished result.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This unlocked striking capabilities — but it also made the old problems impossible to ignore. Small ambiguities in instructions ballooned over ten or twenty steps. Missing background information meant the clerk confidently walked in the wrong direction for minutes at a time. Every task and its associated subtasks came with their own little note — their own tiny prompt — and suddenly the clerk wasn't wrestling with one interaction, but with a swarm of them, all slightly inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what do these issues look like if we were to crack open one of these agentic applications? Where do \"missing background,\" \"forgotten preferences,\" and that \"swarm of tiny prompts\" actually live?\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, they all appear as distinct components of context surrounding a model call: the state and history you carry forward, the prompts and policies you apply, the memories you load, the documents you retrieve, and the structured outputs you expect to receive back. Visually, it looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Context engineering overview](../public/ce-overview.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Things like user input, operational databases, web APIs, and data warehouses all feed into the application’s context layer. Everything inside that dashed red circle is what we, as engineers, design and control before a single token ever reaches the LLM. Instead of only asking, \"What’s the right prompt?\" or \"What’s the right model?\", we are now shifting to ask, “What information should be present at every step of this process, and how do we control it?”\n",
    "\n",
    "That shift, from crafting individual notes to deliberately shaping the information surrounding the application, is what has become known as context engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now ground this idea in an example application for a Redis University course agent (the same agent we built in this course) and watch how context engineering makes a difference."

    "## Context Engineering in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "We can imagine that at most universities today, one of the biggest pain points for learners is the time-suck of researching and selecting their academic classes for the year. In most cases, this involves a tedious process of waiting for their registration time slot to open (as often more senior students have priority), scrolling through various pages of courses/descriptions, and verifying if they meet the prerequisites, among other tasks. There are even dedicated roles designed to help students determine which classes are the right fit and assist them with their planning. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an engineer on an imaginary Redis University Innovation Team, our goal is to solve this issue by creating a seamless interface that helps expedite the research and selection process for a student's courses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now imagine we did indeed build this agent and are running a pilot of the results with a subset of students. Let's examine a common scenario we want the agent to handle: a student seeking advice on which classes to take to help build a career in AI. \n",

With proper context engineering, the advisor carries the context instead of the student: it remembers who Olivia is (major, completions, preferences), filters to relevant options (online, project-based ML), checks prerequisites automatically, turns choices into a sequenced plan and timeline, and can even propose recommended actions (register, notify, send syllabi).

    "\n",
    "These days, even the most powerful AI models have a big limitation: they can only process a fixed amount of text in a single request.\n",
    "\n",
    "This fixed amount is called the **context window**, and is essentially the size of our metaphorical clerk's desk. \n",

    "\n",
    "| Model | Context Window |\n",

    "That remaining space (111,900) might look comforting but remember this is just one turn. Our inputs will likely only grow longer (think a long conversation history), and as they do, models have a harder time producing effective results for tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, [Chroma](https://www.trychroma.com/) (a leading AI research company) revealed a critical challenge related to working with LLMs and their context window: [context rot](https://research.trychroma.com/context-rot) - the phenomenon where LLM performance degrades non-uniformly as input context length increases, even with simple tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we summarized the research findings around the size of context, it would break out into the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Longer context ≠ better context: Reliability drops and accelerates as inputs grow. This means we should treat the window like working memory; budget tokens when possible and keep the slice small.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Relevance rules: High semantic match drives accuracy; loosely related text hurts. We should prioritize optimizing retrieval precision (rerank, tighten filters, rewrite queries).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Distractors are toxic: Similar but wrong snippets do disproportionate damage as length increases. To reduce distractors, we should aggressively filter/threshold, dedupe, and avoid \"just in case\" context.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Placement & structure matter: Models attend unevenly across the window; key facts can be missed when buried. We should surface essentials early, chunk clearly, and summarize instead of pasting raw dumps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, every token spent on one thing is a token NOT available for another. This means when we build these systems, we must constantly decide:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Which context is most relevant?\n",
    "- What can be omitted without hurting quality?\n",
    "- When to retrieve more vs. use what you have?\n",

    "## Other Challenges of Managing Context\n",
    "\n",
    "D. Breunig highlights in [How Contexts Fail (and How to Fix Them)](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html) that there are several other ways context can degrade the performance of your agent, even when you are well within the token limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "He mentions four key failure modes to watch out for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Context Poisoning**: This occurs when an error or hallucination makes its way into your context (e.g., conversation history) and is then treated as fact in subsequent turns. The model \"learns\" the wrong information from its own previous output, leading to a loop of compounding errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Context Distraction**: Sometimes, having *too much* history can be detrimental. If an agent has a massive log of past actions, it may start to over-focus on repeating those past behaviors rather than reasoning about the current, novel situation. It relies on its \"contextual habit\" instead of its training.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Context Confusion**: This happens when the context is cluttered with superfluous information—such as too many available tools or irrelevant document snippets. Even if the model *could* ignore them, the mere presence of these \"distractors\" increases the probability of the model getting confused or trying to use a tool that isn't needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Context Clash**: This is when different parts of your context contradict each other. For example, your system prompt might say one thing, but a retrieved document or an early turn in the conversation history contradicts it. When the model faces this internal conflict, its reasoning capabilities often degrade significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding these failure modes reinforces why context engineering is not just about *compression*—it's about *curation*. We must actively manage, clean, and sometimes even \"forget\" context to keep our agents sharp.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's essential to note that in this course, we will not necessarily solve every one of these failure modes. Some, like context poisoning, remain as complex open research problems in AI. However, we will systematically dismantle the most common ones by building a series of \"progressive agents,\" each designed to overcome specific context limitations."

    "2. There are four types of context we will focus on: system context, user context, conversation context, and retrieved context.\n",
