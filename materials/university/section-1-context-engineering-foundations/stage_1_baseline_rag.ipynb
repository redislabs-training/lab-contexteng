    "\n",
    "Now that you've established some working knowledge of system context, it's time to start exploring our agent's capabilities and, more importantly, its limitations. More specifically, we'll do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Explore the baseline architecture of the simple RAG agent. Our Stage 1 Agent takes the simplest possible approach: Find relevant courses and give the LLM *everything* about them.\n",
    "2.  Witness \"Information Overload\": See firsthand what happens when you retrieve *too much* context.\n",
    "3.  Analyze the Cost: Measure the token usage of a naive approach.\n",

    "## Agent Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "First, an overview of the code. If you want to explore on your own, the baseline agent lives in the `progressive_agents/stage1_baseline_rag/` directory. You can reference the code at any time throughout this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using the following technologies in the stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LangGraph**: The orchestrator. It manages the control flow of our application, defining how data moves between steps (nodes). If you're not familiar with the components of LangGraph, we recommend you check out their overview on [\"Thinking in LangGraph\"](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/thinking-in-langgraph).\n",
    "- **Redis**: Our datastore. It serves as our vector database, allowing us to perform semantic search to find relevant courses.\n",
    "- **LangChain**: The connector. It provides the standard interfaces for interacting with LLMs and prompts.\n",
    "- **OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini)**: Our reasoing model\n",
    "\n",
    "> **A note on architecture**: In a real-world scenario, a simple RAG pipeline doesn't necessarily require a full \"agent\" architecture with state management and graph orchestration. A simple function chain would often suffice. However, for this course, we have implemented it as a basic Agent using LangGraph. This allows us to introduce the core components (state, nodes, workflow) from the start, providing a solid foundation for adding complexity, such as memory, tools, and decision-making, in later stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the agent has three important components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. LangGraph Nodes (agent/nodes.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic is split into two functions (nodes):\n",
    "*   `research_node`:\n",
    "    *   Searches Redis for the top 5 courses matching the user's query.\n",
    "    *   Note that it retrieves the FULL hierarchical data for all 5 courses. This includes every single week of the syllabus, every homework assignment, and every reading list.\n",
    "*   `synthesize_node`:\n",
    "    *   Receives the massive block of text about the 5 courses\n",
    "    *   Sends it all to the LLM with a prompt to answer the user's question.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. LangGraph State (agent/state.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a `TypedDict` to pass data between nodes.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class AgentState(TypedDict):\n",
    "    query: str              # The query sent to the LLM\n",
    "    raw_context: str        # The JSON blob of course data retrieved\n",
    "    final_answer: str       # The LLM's response\n",
    "    total_tokens: int       # Tracking token usage\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. LangGraph Workflow (agent/workflow.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "We use LangGraph to orchestrate the flow. It's a linear graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "graph LR\n",
    "    START([Start]) --> Research[Research Node]\n",
    "    Research --> Synthesize[Synthesize Node]\n",
    "    Synthesize --> END([End])\n",
    "    \n",
    "    style Research fill:#ff9999,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n",
    "    style Synthesize fill:#99ccff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px\n",
