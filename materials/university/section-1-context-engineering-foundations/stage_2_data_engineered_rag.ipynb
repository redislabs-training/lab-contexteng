    "# Stage 2: Data-Engineered RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "In Stage 1, our baseline RAG agent played it safe and sent everything: full-course objects, verbose fields, and lengthy descriptions. That worked, but it came at a cost — simple questions like *\"What computer science courses are available?\"* could trigger 5,000+ extra tokens of context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on to a richer agent architecture (like a ReAct agent), we’re going to pause and ask a simpler question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> “What if we just got smarter about the data we send?”\n",
    "\n",
    "In this stage, we’ll keep the same basic RAG pattern, but engineer the context itself. Since context is just data, we can apply lightweight data engineering techniques to make it more efficient and cleaner for the LLM to consume.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we’ll:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Trim the data: We'll remove noise fields and unnecessary detail so the model only sees what it needs. In most cases, this will be the core course content, including descriptions, learning objectives, and other relevant details.   \n",
    "2. Transform the format into LLM-friendly text: We'll take the raw JSON/course objects and convert them into natural, human-readable text that LLMs handle more easily.\n",
    "3. Context depth control: We'll use compact course summaries when we need an overview, and keep full details for when they’re truly needed.\n",
    "4. Experiment:  We'll see how the token count changes compared to our original baseline RAG call.\n",
    "\n",
    "That last point will serve as a gentle introduction to a powerful concept known as progressive disclosure: Start with a brief summary view and reveal full details only upon demand. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this stage, you’ll see progressive disclosure in action through “summary vs. full” course representations, and in the next stage, we’ll push this further inside a full agent loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "With just these small changes, you’ll see how we can reduce the context size (tokens) by around 50% while maintaining answer quality essentially unchanged.\n",

    "## Optimization: Human-Readable, LLM-Friendly Course Text\n",
    "Our course data currently resides in a structured `Course` object that mirrors how it's stored in the Redis database: numerous fields, some student-facing and some purely system-facing. In Stage 1, we essentially dumped that structure into the prompt, which meant the LLM had to parse a lot of syntax and noise it did not really need.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two things to note about this approach:\n",
    "1. JSON-style representations are full of extra characters: quotes, braces, commas, and field names.\n",
    "2. The shape is designed for machines and storage, not for a model trying to answer a question in natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, think about the difference between these two versions of the same idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"course_code\": \"CS101\",\n",
    "  \"title\": \"Introduction to Computer Science\",\n",
    "  \"department\": \"Computer Science\"\n",

    "```txt\n",
    "CS101: Introduction to Computer Science\n",
    "Department: Computer Science\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first version spends tokens on punctuation and keys; the second goes straight to the meaning. Across dozens or hundreds of courses, that extra syntax turns into a lot of wasted tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will build `transform_course_to_text`, a function that reshapes a `Course` object into a compact, human-readable description. More specifically, we will accomplish the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get rid of  system-oriented fields like IDs and timestamps\n",
    "2. Remove null and empty fields (e.g., when a course has no prerequesites)\n",
    "3. Organize the important fields (title, level, format, instructor, prerequisites, learning objectives) into a simple text block that an LLM can scan easily\n",
    "\n",
    "The result will be a prompt-ready course description that is both easier for the model to work with and significantly cheaper in tokens than sending the raw object or its JSON representation.\n",

    "- Cleaned course data by removing database artifacts, noise fields, and unnecessary details\n",
    "- Transformed structured data from JSON into LLM-friendly natural text format\n",
    "- Optimized context with ultra-compact summaries for maximum token efficiency\n",
    "- Compared different representation strategies (raw JSON vs. clean text vs. compact summaries)\n",
    "\n",
    "The key transformation is understanding that context is just data, and data can be engineered. By applying lightweight data engineering techniques—cleaning, transforming, and optimizing—you achieved a 91% reduction in token usage while maintaining answer quality. This demonstrates that more context isn't always better; curated, well-formatted context is.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Stage 3, you'll take the next leap: hierarchical retrieval with progressive disclosure. Instead of deciding upfront whether to send summaries or full details, you'll build an intelligent agent that retrieves summaries first, evaluates relevance, and fetches full syllabi only for the most relevant courses. This adaptive approach gives you both low token usage and high detail exactly when needed."
