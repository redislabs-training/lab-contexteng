    "# Stage 5: Working Memory for Multi-Turn Conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Stage 4, we built a ReAct agent that could dynamically reason about its context needs; thinking through what information it needed, using tools to retrieve it, and looping until it had enough context to answer confidently. At the end of Stage 4, we also demonstrated multi-turn conversations by manually managing a conversation history list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Stage 4 - Multi-turn conversation approach\n",
    "conversation_history = []\n",
    "\n",
    "# Turn 1\n",
    "result1 = await app.ainvoke({\n",
    "    \"input\": \"Tell me about CS002\", \n",
    "    \"history\": conversation_history\n",
    "})\n",
    "conversation_history.append(f\"User: Tell me about CS002\")\n",
    "conversation_history.append(f\"Agent: {result1['final_response'][:200]}...\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Turn 2 - with reference to previous turn\n",
    "result2 = await app.ainvoke({\n",
    "    \"input\": \"What are the prerequisites for that course?\",\n",
    "    \"history\": conversation_history  # Agent can now see Turn 1\n",
    "})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This was our first introduction to managing conversational context through \"memory\". When we manually passed the conversation history, the agent successfully resolved \"that course\" to CS002. The reasoning capabilities were there, but the memory infrastructure wasn't. We couldn't persist conversations across sessions, extract important facts for later recall, deduplicate repeated information, or manage memory as conversations grew longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider this a different scenario showing the limitation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Turn 1:**  \n",
    "👤 \"What is CS002?\"  \n",
    "🤖 \"CS002 is Data Structures and Algorithms...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Turn 2:**\n",
    "👤 \"What are the prerequisites for that course?\"  \n",
    "🤖 ❌ \"I'm not sure which course you are referring to\" *(Agen't doesn't understand what \"that course\" refers to)*\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving this type of limitation is the focus of Stage 5, where we will introduce memory and shift the focus from managing retrieved context to managing conversational context. To do this, we'll use a new tool: [Redis Agent Memory Server (RAMS)](https://github.com/redis/agent-memory-server). \n",
    "\n",
    "RAMS is a fast and flexible memory layer for AI agents. Adding it will complete our agent stack, transforming our agent from a powerful single-query reasoner into a true conversational partner with persistent context (memory) across sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin working with memory, let's examine the key concepts surrounding how RAMS manages memory and its role within our agent architecture. "

    "## Memory Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### How RAMS Manages Memory: The Two-Tier Model\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of implementing the memory infrastructure of our agent is how RAMS manages conversational context. RAMS isn't just a key-value store for conversations—it implements a two-tier memory system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Working Memory (Session-Scoped)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Working memory represents recent conversation history for the current session. It captures the immediate context of the ongoing conversation. Each session maintains its own working memory, perfect for managing multiple concurrent conversations per user.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Long-Term Memory (Cross-Session)  \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, long-term memory represents persistent facts extracted from all conversations over time. It stores important information that transcends individual conversations. Facts are automatically extracted, deduplicated, and compressed for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quick comparison of the two memory types:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Working Memory | Long-Term Memory |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| Session-scoped | User-scoped OR Application-scoped |\n",
    "| Current conversation | Important facts, rules, knowledge |\n",
    "| Persists for session | Persists across sessions |\n",
    "| Full message history | Extracted knowledge (user + domain) |\n",
    "| Loaded/saved each turn | Searched when needed |\n",
    "| Challenge: Context window limits | Challenge: Storage growth |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this stage, we'll focus exclusively on working memory. The agent will load and saves conversation history, while RAMS will extract facts to long-term storage invisibly. In Stage 6 will add explicit tools (`search_memories`, `store_memory`) for the agent to deliberately query and manipulate long-term memory, but for now, we won't need to worry about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once implemented, our Stage 5 architecture wraps the ReAct agent with a memory layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Working Memory Lifecycle\n",
    "\n",
    "With RAMS managing the storage and organization of memories, our agent needs to orchestrate when and how to interact with it. The working memory lifecycle in Stage 5 will follow three steps on every turn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load Working Memory: At the start of each turn, the agent will load the conversation history from RAMS. This provides the immediate context for the current conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Process: The agent will use the conversation history as input to its reasoning process. This allows it to understand references like \"that course\" in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Save Working Memory: After generating a response, the agent will save the new conversation turn back to RAMS. This updates the working memory for future turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern repeats on every turn:\n",
    "- **Before reasoning**: Load history to provide context\n",
    "- **During reasoning**: ReAct agent uses history (\"that course\" → CS002)\n",
    "- **After reasoning**: Save the new exchange for future turns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you'll implement the core memory infrastructure for working memory by building the following nodes: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`load_working_memory_node`**  \n",
    "A LangGraph node that retrieves conversation history from RAMS at the start of each turn and adds it to the agent's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`save_working_memory_node`**  \n",
    "A LangGraph node that stores the new conversation turn (user query + agent response) back to RAMS after reasoning completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into implementation, let's review the supporting code that has already been implemented for you in the production agent. You'll focus on implementing the memory nodes, while these components handle configuration, state management, and workflow orchestration."

    "## Implementing Working Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supporting Infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few pieces of supporting infrastructure in the agent code that you should be aware of.\n",
    "\n",
    "For one, we abstract away configuration details for the Redis Agent Memory Server located in the [nodes.py](../progressive_agents/stage5_working_memory/agent/nodes.py#L55-L62) file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def get_memory_client() -> MemoryAPIClient:\n",
    "    \"\"\"Get the configured Agent Memory Server client.\"\"\"\n",
    "    config = MemoryClientConfig(\n",
    "        base_url=os.getenv(\"AGENT_MEMORY_URL\", \"http://localhost:8088\"),\n",
    "        default_namespace=\"course_qa_agent\",\n",
    "    )\n",
    "    return MemoryAPIClient(config=config)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the workflow for the agent is now modified to use a TypedDict to track all state fields across nodes in the [state.py](../progressive_agents/stage5_working_memory/agent/state.py#L28-L80) file. \n",
    "\n",
    "For implementing memory, you'll notice there are `session_id`, `student_id`, and `conversation_history` fields: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class WorkflowState(TypedDict):\n",
    "    # Core fields you'll work with:\n",
    "    session_id: str                          # Session identifier\n",
    "    student_id: str                          # User identifier  \n",
    "    conversation_history: List[Dict[str, str]]  # Previous messages\n",
    "    user_query: str                          # Current question\n",
    "    agent_response: str                      # Current answer\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Plus many other fields for intent classification,\n",
    "    # entity extraction, caching, metrics, etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This state flows through every node in the workflow, with each node reading and updating relevant fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the complete workflow orchestrates multiple nodes with conditional routing in the [workflow.py#L67-L100](../progressive_agents/stage5_working_memory/agent/workflow.py#L67-L100) file. You'll implement the `load_working_memory_node` and `save_working_memory_node` functions that plug into this graph as noted below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "workflow = StateGraph(WorkflowState)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add all nodes\n",
    "workflow.add_node(\"load_memory\", load_working_memory_node)\n",
    "workflow.add_node(\"classify_intent\", classify_intent_node)\n",
    "workflow.add_node(\"react_agent\", react_agent_node)\n",
    "workflow.add_node(\"save_memory\", save_working_memory_node)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define flow with conditional routing\n",
    "workflow.set_entry_point(\"load_memory\")\n",
    "workflow.add_edge(\"load_memory\", \"classify_intent\")\n",
    "workflow.add_conditional_edges(\"classify_intent\", route_after_intent, {...})\n",
    "workflow.add_edge(\"react_agent\", \"save_memory\")\n",
    "workflow.add_edge(\"save_memory\", END)\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "### From Conversations to Persistent Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "Working memory is important because it captures the current session, but what happens to valuable information when the session ends? If a student spends 20 minutes discussing their interest in machine learning courses, that knowledge shouldn't disappear when they close their browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where RAMS's two-tier memory system shines. Every time you call `put_working_memory()` to save a conversation turn, RAMS automatically performs several intelligent operations behind the scenes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analyzes the Conversation Turn**  \n",
    "RAMS uses an LLM to examine the user query and agent response, identifying important information worth preserving long-term.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extracts Key Facts**  \n",
    "Instead of storing verbatim conversation history, RAMS extracts compressed facts:\n",
    "   - \"Student is interested in machine learning courses\"\n",
    "   - \"Student asked about CS004 prerequisites\"\n",
    "   - \"Student prefers beginner-level content\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Stores in Long-Term Memory**  \n",
    "These facts are saved to long-term memory with vector embeddings for semantic search and graph relationships for structured queries. They persist across sessions and are available to all future conversations for that user.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deduplicates Information**  \n",
    "If a student asks \"What is CS002?\" multiple times across turns, RAMS recognizes the redundancy and maintains a single fact rather than duplicating information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This entire pipeline happens automatically and invisibly in Stage 5. You don't need to call any extraction APIs or manage the transition from working memory to long-term memory—RAMS handles it transparently when you save working memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** RAMS supports [multiple memory extraction strategies](https://redis.github.io/agent-memory-server/memory-extraction-strategies/) that you can configure to customize how facts are identified and stored (such as entity extraction, topic modeling, or custom extraction prompts). In this course, we use the default extraction strategy and don't explicitly configure it in our RAMS setup which allows RAMS to intelligently handle fact extraction out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "The automatic fact extraction also creates a powerful compression mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Working Memory:                   Long-Term Memory:\n",
    "Turn 1: \"What is CS004?\"         → Fact: \"Student interested in CS004\"\n",
    "  Response: 300 tokens\n",
    "Turn 2: \"Prerequisites?\"         → Fact: \"Student asked about prerequisites\"\n",
    "  Response: 200 tokens\n",
    "Turn 3: \"More details?\"          → Merged with: \"Student needs CS004 info\"\n",
    "  Response: 250 tokens\n",

    "Total: ~750 tokens               Total: ~50 tokens (15x compression)\n",
