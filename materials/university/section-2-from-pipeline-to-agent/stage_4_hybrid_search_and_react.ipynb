    "# Stage 4: Hybrid Search & The ReAct Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Stage 3, we made significant progress in context management around retrieved context. We built an intent-driven architecture that dynamically selected between hierarchical data views (summaries vs. full details), assembled context using progressive disclosure, and implemented a quality validation loop that automatically retried with different strategies when context was insufficient. We even introduced tool calling where the LLM could decide *when* to search for courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was effective for managing context when queries fit our predefined categories. But we were still pre-programming every path through the system. We decided which intents existed, which search strategies to use for each intent, and what fallback rules to follow when context was insufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real production agents work differently. Think about how ChatGPT or Claude handle queries. They reason about what context they need and how to retrieve it. They don't necessarily follow pre-programmed paths; they make dynamic decisions based on the specific query in front of them. In these types of systems the job shifts from programming all the paths to providing the tools and guidance agents need to make smart context decisions themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shift becomes critical when we add conversation memory in the next stage (Stage 5). Memory introduces fundamental ambiguity our stage 3 agent simply cannot handle. Consider the following query: \n",
    "\n",
    "*\"What are the prerequisites for that course?\"* \n",
    "\n",
    "There are core challenges with a query like this for our current system. Which course? The one from three messages ago? The last course code mentioned? A course implied by context? \n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-programmed logic would need to account for every possible reference pattern. A reasoning agent can analyze the conversation history and determine what \"that course\" means in context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build agents that reason about their context needs, we need a new cognitive architecture: the ReAct pattern (Reasoning + Acting). This allows the agent to:\n",
    "1. Analyze the user's request\n",
    "2. Decide what context is missing\n",
    "3. Retrieve that specific context using tools\n",
    "4. Evaluate if the context is sufficient, and if not, loop back to get more\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this, we need two components working together:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. The ReAct agent architecture**\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasoning engine that replaces our Stage 3 pipeline. The agent will think through what context it needs, retrieve it, evaluate if it's sufficient, and loop until it has everything required to answer confidently. Its structure will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "graph TD\n",
    "    Q[Query] --> RA[ReAct Agent]\n",
    "\n",
    "    subgraph ReAct Loop\n",
    "        RA --> T1[💭 Thought: What context do I need?]\n",
    "        T1 --> A1[🔧 Action: Retrieve Context]\n",
    "        A1 --> O1[👁️ Observation: Review Data]\n",
    "        O1 --> T2[💭 Thought: Is this enough?]\n",
    "        T2 --> |No| A1\n",
    "        T2 --> |Yes| F[✅ FINISH]\n",
    "    end\n",
    "\n",
    "    F --> R[Response]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. A hybrid search tool**\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the new architecture, we're also going to provide one more improvement to the way we search for the right context. \n",
    "\n",
    "In stage 3's hierarchical context assembly (summaries vs. full details, progressive disclosure), we solved the problem of *how much* information to return and *how to structure it*. That was context engineering for presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this stage we're going to implement the ability to perform hybrid search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hybrid search adds the ability to combine semantic search with exact filtering:\n",
    "- Semantic search alone: \"Find courses similar to 'CS101'\" (might return CS101, but also other intro courses)\n",
    "- Exact filtering: \"Find the course with course_code='CS101'\" (guaranteed to return only CS101)\n",
    "- Hybrid: \"Find advanced courses about machine learning\" (semantic search for 'machine learning' + filter for difficulty_level='advanced')\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between these approaches is intentional precision vs. semantic luck. Our hybrid search tool exposes both capabilities, allowing a reasoning agent to choose the right retrieval strategy based on the query's needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will become critical when:\n",
    "- The user asks for something specific (\"Tell me about CS101\" - why search 5 similar courses when you can filter for exactly CS101?)\n",
    "- The user needs combined criteria (\"Most advanced CS course\" - semantic search + exact difficulty filter)\n",
    "- Multi-step reasoning requires exact references (\"What are the prerequisites for that course?\" - need to filter for the exact course code from context)\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these components create an agent that can reason about both *what* context it needs and *how* to retrieve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start building.\n"

    "## Part 1: Building the Hybrid Search Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we're going to build out the hybrid search capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Stage 3, you built a `search_courses_tool` that used a pre-built helper function (`search_courses_sync`) to handle retrieval. Under the hood, that helper used RedisVL's [`VectorQuery`](https://docs.redisvl.com/en/latest/api/query.html#vectorquery) class to perform semantic/vector search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we're upgrading to hybrid search by working directly with a underlying `course_manager.search_courses()` method and leveraging more of RedisVL. In addition to `VectorQuery` for KNN search, RedisVL also provides the [`FilterQuery`](https://docs.redisvl.com/en/latest/api/query.html#filterquery) class for field-level filters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our hybrid implementation combines both: we use vector search to retrieve semantically similar candidates, then apply filtering to guarantee exact matches when needed. This gives us the speed of vector search with the precision of exact matching. (Note: RedisVL also offers a [`HybridQuery`](https://docs.redisvl.com/en/latest/api/query.html#hybridquery) class for combining vector + full-text search, but our use case is simpler since we only need \"vector search OR exact field matching\" rather than \"vector + text ranking\".)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create a `search_courses_hybrid` function with an optional `course_code` parameter. When provided, the function switches to exact mode—searching a larger set and filtering for matches. When `None`, it uses semantic search (the Stage 3 behavior). In Part 2, the ReAct agent will reason about which mode to use based on the query.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have a hybrid search tool that can retrieve context with precision, we can build an agent that reasons about how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reasoning happens in a loop structure. The agent alternates between three phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thought**: The agent reasons about what it needs to do next. \"I don't have enough information yet. I should search for courses about machine learning.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Action**: The agent decides to either call a tool or provide a final answer. \"I'll use search_courses with query='machine learning' and no course_code (semantic search).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Observation**: The agent sees the result of its action. \"I received 3 courses about machine learning. Now I have enough context to answer the user's question.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop continues until the agent decides it has sufficient information to answer. Within a single query, each iteration builds on the previous and the agent sees its own thoughts and observations in the message history, allowing it to build up context progressively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to implement the architecture, we'll need the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A System Prompt**: Similar to how we designed a system prompt before, we'll need instructions that tell the LLM how to format its thoughts and actions. This defines the ReAct protocol the agent will follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Parser**: A function that extracts structured decisions from the LLM's free-text output. It identifies what action the agent wants to take and what inputs to provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The Loop**: A `react_agent_node` function that orchestrates the cycle. It calls the LLM, parses the response, executes tools, and feeds observations back into the conversation.\n",

    "- Only use ONE Action per turn\n",
    "- Action Input must be valid JSON matching the tool's parameters\n",
    "- Use \"exact_match\" strategy when the user mentions specific course codes\n",
    "- Use \"hybrid\" strategy for topic-based searches\n",
    "- Use FINISH when you're ready to provide the final answer\n",
    "\n",
    "INTERPRETING SEARCH RESULTS:\n",
    "- If a search returns course data with an empty field (e.g., \"prerequisites\": []), \n",
    "  that means the field has NO VALUE - not that the search failed\n",
    "- Empty prerequisites [] means \"no prerequisites required\" - this IS a valid answer\n",
    "- Only retry a search if you get an actual error or no courses are found\n",
    "- Do NOT keep searching with different strategies when you already have the course data\n",

    "\n",
    "In this task, you will implement the core ReAct loop logic. Your implementation will match the production version used in [react_agent.py](../progressive_agents/stage4_hybrid_search_react/agent/react_agent.py), except we'll skip the logging code to focus on the essential logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you start coding, here's what's already provided for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `AgentState` - A TypedDict that defines the structure of our state:\n",
    "   - `input`: The user's query string\n",
    "   - `history`: List of previous conversation turns\n",
    "   - `final_response`: The final answer to return\n",
    "     \n",
    "2. `messages` - A list of `AIMessage` and `HumanMessage` objects that stores the conversation history. Each iteration appends new messages so the LLM can see what happened previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `get_react_llm()` - A helper function imported from the production code that returns a configured LLM instance with the right parameters (model, temperature, max_tokens, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `execute_react_tool()` - A helper function imported from the production code that handles tool lookup and execution. You just call it with the tool name and arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `tools_map` - A dictionary mapping tool names (like \"search_courses\") to their actual function implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `REACT_SYSTEM_PROMPT` - The system prompt that instructs the LLM to use ReAct format (Thought/Action/Action Input).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `parse_react_output()` - A function that parses the LLM's text response and extracts the thought, action, and action_input fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, implement the ReAct loop logic. At a high level the  loop needs to:\n",
    "1. Parse the LLM response to extract the action\n",
    "2. Check if it's a FINISH action (completion)\n",
    "3. Execute tool actions with proper error handling\n",
    "4. Append observations to message history for the next iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: By appending observations to the message list, the LLM sees the full conversation history on the next iteration. It can reason about what it learned and decide what to do next.\n",

    "<summary>🛠️ Show Implementation Details</summary>\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "    \n",
    "Step 1: **Parse the LLM output**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `parse_react_output()` function returns a dictionary. You need to:\n",
    "- Call `parse_react_output(response_text)` and store the result in a variable called `parsed`\n",
    "- Extract the `\"action\"` key from the dictionary stored in `parsed` and store it in a variable called `action`\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives you access to what action the LLM wants to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: **Check for FINISH action**\n",
    "\n",
    "The production implementation uses \"FINISH\" to signal completion. You need to:\n",
    "- Check if `action` exists and if it equals \"FINISH\" (case-insensitive using `.upper()`)\n",
    "- If it is finished, get the final answer from `parsed[\"action_input\"]`\n",
    "- Return a dictionary with key `\"final_response\"` containing that answer\n",
    "- Use `or \"\"` to handle None values\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: **Execute tool actions**\n",
    "\n",
    "For tool actions like \"search_courses\", you need to:\n",
    "- Check if the `action` is a key in the `tools_map` dictionary\n",
    "- Get the action input string from `parsed[\"action_input\"]`\n",
    "- Parse that string as JSON using `json.loads()` to get a dictionary of arguments\n",
    "- Call the helper function `execute_react_tool(action, tool_args)` with await\n",
    "- Wrap the tool execution in a try/except block to catch any errors (JSON parsing or tool execution)\n",
    "- If there's an error, set the observation to an error message string\n",
    "- Print the observation (truncate to 200 characters for readability)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `execute_react_tool()` helper function handles looking up the tool in the map and calling it for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: **Append observation to messages**\n",
    "\n",
    "After executing a tool successfully, you need to update the message history so the LLM sees what happened:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Append the LLM's response as an `AIMessage` with content=response_textThis helps the LLM self-correct on the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Append the observation as a `HumanMessage` with content=f\"Observation: {observation}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This uses LangChain's message types (AIMessage/HumanMessage) instead of tuples, matching the production code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: **Handle invalid actions**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the action isn't recognized (not in tools_map and not FINISH), you need to give the LLM feedback:\n",
    "- Append the LLM's response as an `AIMessage`\n",
    "- Append an error message as a `HumanMessage`: \"Error: Unknown action...\"\n",
    "- Include the action name and list valid options\n",
