    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of Stage 5, we witnessed something interesting: RAMS was quietly extracting facts from every conversation turn and storing them in long-term memory. The compression ratios were impressive! 750 tokens of conversation distilled into 50 tokens of knowledge. But there was a catch. Our agent couldn't *use* any of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "All that accumulated knowledge of student preferences, past questions, and expressed interests sat in long-term memory. This creates a frustrating scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Session 1:**  \n",
    "👤 \"I prefer online courses and I'm interested in machine learning.\"  \n",
    "🤖 \"Great! Let me search for ML courses...\"  \n",
    "*(RAMS extracts and stores: \"Student prefers online courses\", \"Student interested in ML\")*\n",
    "\n",
    "**[User returns the next day and starts a new session]**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Session 2:**  \n",

    "🤖 \"I'm not sure what you're looking for. Could you tell me your preferences?\"  \n",
    "*(The knowledge exists in long-term memory... but the agent can't reach it)*\n",
    "\n",
    "The current version of our agent has amnesia despite having a full memory system. Stage 5 gave us the infrastructure, and now we need to give the agent the tools to actually use it.\n",

    "\n",
    "This type of memory (the default for AMS) stores timeless facts and preferences. Things like \"Student prefers online courses\" or \"CS401 requires CS201 as a prerequisite\" are examples of semantic memories. They can be user-scoped (personalizing for a specific student) or application-scoped (domain knowledge for everyone). These types of memories are compact and searchable, making them the default choice for most information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Episodic memory\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of memory captures time-bound events where sequence matters. Things like \"Student enrolled in CS101 on 2024-09-15\" or \"Completed CS101 with grade A\" are episodic memories. This type of memory is most useful when the timeline or temporal progression is meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Message memory  \n",
    "\n",
    "This type of memory stores full conversation snippets where the complete context is crucial. This preserves detailed discussions, nuanced advice, or explanations that would be lost if summarized. However, message memories are token-expensive and should be used sparingly.\n",

    "### 📌 Task 1: Searching Memories\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the agent to be able to search long term memory, we'll need the `search_memories` tool implementation to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accept a natural language query and optional limit parameter\n",
    "2. Call the Agent Memory Server's long-term memory search endpoint\n",
    "3. Return a list of relevant memories formatted for the LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "In the starter code, we've provided the `SearchMemoriesInput` Pydantic model (similar to the tool input schemas you built in Stage 3) that defines the expected parameters. Your task is to implement the tool function that searches long-term memory and returns relevant results.\n",

    "\n",
    "Use the `@tool` decorator from LangChain with the `args_schema` parameter set to `SearchMemoriesInput`. This tells LangChain how to parse and validate the tool's inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Validate Student ID**\n",
    "\n",
    "Check if the `student_id` parameter is provided. If not, return an empty list—we can't search memories without knowing whose memories to search.\n",

    "This returns a response object with a `.memories` attribute containing the list of memory objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Format Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "The memory objects returned from Agent Memory Server contain several fields, but we only need a few for the LLM. Convert each memory object to a dictionary with these fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `text`: The actual memory content (e.g., \"Student prefers online courses\")\n",
    "- `memory_type`: The type of memory (semantic, episodic, or message—as discussed earlier)\n",
    "- `topics`: A list of topic tags that were assigned when the memory was stored (e.g., `[\"preferences\", \"learning_style\"]`). These help categorize memories and can be useful for filtering.\n",

    "\n",
    "**The Problem We Solved**\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of this notebook, we identified a frustrating limitation: our Stage 5 agent had amnesia between sessions. RAMS was automatically extracting facts to long-term memory, but the agent had no way to access them. Users had to repeat their preferences every time they started a new conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution We Built**\n",
    "\n",
    "You implemented two tools that unlock long-term memory for the agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`search_memories`**: Enables the agent to query stored facts, preferences, and history from previous sessions. When a user asks \"What courses fit my preferences?\" in a new session, the agent can now recall who they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`store_memory`**: Gives the agent explicit control over what gets remembered. When a user says \"Remember that I prefer evening classes,\" the agent actively stores that fact rather than relying on automatic extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Patterns We Discovered**\n",
    "\n",
    "Through testing, you observed how the agent orchestrates these tools dynamically:\n",
    "- Storing information when users share preferences\n",
    "- Searching memories before personalized recommendations  \n",
    "- Chaining multiple tools for complex queries\n",
    "- Skipping memory tools entirely for factual questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't hardcoded logic—it's the ReAct pattern enabling the agent to reason about what information it needs and select the right tool to get it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Complete Journey\n",
    "\n",
    "You've now completed the entire progressive agents learning path. Here's the full architecture you've built from the ground up:\n",

    "| Section | Stage | What You Built |\n",
    "|---------|-------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Context Engineering Foundations** | Stage 1 | Baseline RAG with retrieved context + generation |\n",

    "| | Stage 4 | Hybrid search + ReAct with visible reasoning and tool orchestration |\n",
    "| **Memory & Context** | Stage 5 | Working memory for multi-turn conversation continuity |\n",
    "| | Stage 6 | Full memory with explicit long-term memory control |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each stage built on the previous one, and together they form a complete context engineering system:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context engineering** taught you how to structure, chunk, and assemble information for optimal LLM consumption\n",
    "- **Intelligent retrieval** gave you multiple strategies (semantic, exact match, hybrid) to find the right information\n",
    "- **Agentic reasoning** enabled visible decision-making through the ReAct pattern\n",
    "- **Memory management** provided both automatic extraction and explicit control over what the agent remembers\n",

    "\n",
    "You've mastered the basics of context engineering for AI agents. The concepts and patterns you've learned—hierarchical context assembly, hybrid search strategies, ReAct reasoning, and two-tier memory management—are the building blocks of sophisticated, context-aware AI systems.\n",
